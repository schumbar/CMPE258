# Short Story Assignment

## Assignment Description

Please ensure you fill in your project and short story assignment details in the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rB5PVINkWlICefwzG1HioCZQCYJJJcCCxOJHXipctfM/edit?usp=sharing).

1. The short story assignment should be a paper review on large language models or foundation models.
2. Some examples of topics can include but not limited to: tabular foundation models, graph foundation models, time-series foundation models, etc.
3. The paper should be written in the second half of 2023 or 2024.
4. It is strongly recommended to have a survey paper. If not, get a paper accepted in NIPS 2023, or ICML 2024, or ICLR 2024 etc. but should be very relevant.
5. TurnItIn and other tools will be ran on the paper to ensure it is not auto generated or plagiarized.
6. You will need to re-write the summary of the paper in your own words.
7. You can search arxiv, google scholar, or other citations of an existing survey.
8. You will publish a medium article with pictures and illustrations.
9. The goal of the assignment is to go deep into one area, provide all the data from survey paper.
10. The size and format should be structured.
11. OPTIONAL: You can write your own survey paper yourself if you feel confident enough.
12. Ensure that you have a paper and presentation review by one of your teammates. Ensure this is something that they understand fully and can provide feedback. Quote the paper on the bottom of your medium.com article.
13. This is an individual assignment.
14. Ensure that the deliverables are all in a public GitHub directory with a README.md file. You should include a slide deck, a youtube video explaining your short story, the paper with slides, and a medium article link. Be sure that you include the link to the GitHub directory within the spreadsheet.
15. The video should be 15-25 minutes in length, the slides should be in either PDF or PPT format, and the medium article and slideshare link should be viewable as well.

Turn the content of the paper/topic into a nice article (PLEASE REMEMBER - DO NOT SUBMIT EXISTING MEDIUM ARTICLE - YOU HAVE TO WRITE MEDIUM ARTICLE FROM SCRATCH AND PUBLISH IT - not cut and paste test or use chatgpt - paraphrase and rewrite summarize - you can take pictures from the original paper - YOU NEED TO REFER THE PAPER details in the beginning or end of your article ) for publishing in medium.com (add more survey papers content together as well) - focus on gist rather than math depth - focus on architecture, ablation studies, metrics etc.,. rather than going into the weeds deeply. as many pictures and visualizations and your own two cents on papers.
