# Assignment 01

## Assignment Description

Please note that there are 6 parts to this assignment, which are labeled below. 

### 1. No Code Models

- **Objective**: Build one image model, one pose model, one audio model using Teachable Machines to showcase in class.
- **Demonstration**: Demo in class your innovative work. You can find inspiration from this [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQY2H8rRoyvzSZZuF0qJpoJxZR1NgzcZw).
- **Submission**: Demonstrate and submit to the Teachable Machines group for acceptance to showcase your work.

### 2. On Device Models with No Customization

- **Objective**: Build an app demonstrating MediaPipe on-device model capability on Android.
- **Hint**: Get inspired from this [MediaPipe Image Generation Basic Android Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/mp-image-generation-basic-android#0).

### 3. Custom Model Training Blackbox Way Using Transfer Learning with ML Kit

- **Objective**: Build an Android app using AutoML Vision App.
- **Hint**: Refer to this [AutoML Vision Edge in ML Kit Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/automl-vision-edge-in-mlkit#0) for inspiration.

### 4. Custom Classifier with Keras Models

- **Objective**: Build a custom flower recognizer using Colab and deploy it on a phone.
- **Hint**: Check out this [Codelab on recognizing flowers with TensorFlow on Android](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/recognize-flowers-with-tensorflow-on-android-beta#0).

### 5. Custom Classifier Deployed on Web

- **Objective**: Build a comment classifier web app with custom training data.
- **Hint**: Visit [Google Developers Pathways](https://developers.google.com/learn/pathways/on-device-ml-6) for guidance.

### 6. Embedding Based ML App Deployed on Phone

- **Objective**: Build a product search app using embeddings and index out of the box.
- **Hint**: Look into this [On-Device ML Pathway](https://developers.google.com/learn/pathways/on-device-ml-3) for ideas.

### Additional Instructions

- Customize the above for various other ideas. Consider consulting ChatGPT for help with coding and novel ideas.
- More hints can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/learn/topics/on-device-ml#build-your-first-on-device-ml-app). Try out 5 different varied scenarios, like text, image, object.

#### Notes

- Create a proper GitHub directory and subdirectories with clear naming conventions and README.
- Record a video demonstrating each app, explaining how it was done, and upload it along with all the artifacts.
- Ensure your demonstration is original and not a copy of default demos.
