        "## Assignment Description\n",
        "In this assignment, we are tasked with replicating a series of experiments conducted with closed and open-source Language Model Models (LLMs) as presented in the references section.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your primary objective is to replicate the experiments and modify them to perform alternative tasks. Instead of using the provided SQL dataset, you will be utilizing different datasets available at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/knowrohit07) to demonstrate your adaptability and creativity.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Tasks:\n",
        "1. Reproduce the experiments showcased in the provided YouTube videos, ensuring that you implement all aspects such as prompt-based generation, fine-tuning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), local interpreter, function calling, and llama.cpp CPU inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Creatively adapt the Colab notebooks from the YouTube videos to highlight innovative use cases and applications of LLMs.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. If necessary, make the required adjustments to the Colab notebooks to ensure they function correctly. Document these modifications in detail.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Produce a demonstration video that showcases the functionality of your modified Colab notebooks and your innovative use cases. Ensure the video is linked in your documentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Please note that it is essential to reference the summarized versions of the YouTube videos available at [Summarize.tech](https://www.summarize.tech/) as they provide an overview of the content and serve as a starting point for your experiments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your assignment should reflect your ability to replicate and creatively extend the experiments, as well as your capacity to document and present your work effectively. Please feel free to reach out if you encounter any issues with the Colab notebooks that require minor adjustments.\n",
        "\n",
        "### References Used\n",
        "1. [A Hackers' Guide to Language Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU): This video showcases various experiments using LLMs.\n",
