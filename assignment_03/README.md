# Assignment 03

## Assignment Description

Perform the following tasks:

a) Use FastAI to write a detailed Colab notebook (without copying from hints) that shows training and inference for the following tasks using FastAI. Showcase results and metrics:

- Vision object detection task
- Vision segmentation task
- Tabular task
- Recommendation task

b) Use Hugging Face Transformers API for various tasks:

- Text classification
- Named entity recognition
- Question answering
- Text summarization
- Translation
- Zero-shot classification
- Computer vision
- Audio
- Table QA

c) Use Keras-NLP for various NLP tasks:

- Inference with a pretrained classifier
- Fine-tuning a pretrained backbone
- Fine-tuning with user-controlled preprocessing
- Fine-tuning a custom model

d) Use Keras-CV for various vision tasks:

- Object detection using the YOLO model
- Inference with a pretrained classifier
- Fine-tuning a pretrained backbone
- Training an image classifier from scratch
- Training a custom object detection model

Be sure to write a README.md file and create a proper GitHub directory structure for your assignment.
