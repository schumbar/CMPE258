# Assignment 05

## Assignment Guidelines

It is important to note that you will need to adhere to the following guidelines:

1. You must create a 3-layer neural network.
2. You must use einsum.
3. Use a non-linear 3-dimensional equation.
4. Generate syntetic data using the equation you used and plot using 4-d plot in matplotlib.

After completing the colabs, you will need to upload a video showing the code checked into GitHub as well as a code walkthrough of the main sections and any final output that is generated.

## Assignment Description

You will need to complete the following colabs:

1. Numpy
2. PyTorch **without** built-in layer functionality
3. **PyTorch WITH built-in functionality**
4. **PyTorch Lightning Version**
5. **Tensorflow** (i.e. scratch, built-in, low-level API, and high-level API)
6. **JAX**
