# Assignment 06

## Assignment Description

Note this is multiple colabs assignment - please put proper readme with all colabs - do not copy paste from hint colabs. write it in your own way.

Give a detailed video going over the code of each colab and upload it.

Make sure you organize your GitHub directory properly and read.me

You should execute and show while explaining what you wrote in colab s.

### Part 01 Description

Write simple colabs to illustrate various data augmentation and generalization techniques (with A/B tests).
Write in tensorflow.

a. l1 l2

b. dropout

c. earlystop

d. montecarlo dropout

e. various initializations and when to use what

f. batch norm

g. custsom dropout, custom regularization

h. using callbacks and tensorboard

i. Using keras tuner

j. use keras cv data augmentation

k. Data Augmentation and Classification for Image

L. FastAI Data Augmentation Capabilities

### Part 02

Write a colab/colabs where you use advanced Keras deep learning constructs and concepts.

Please ensure you use the links provided for hints as examples. Use your own creativity. Properly annotate your colab/colabs appropriately and write proper explanation and description. Properly demonstrate each of these aspects with either individual colabs or one colab having all these.

A. User custom learning rate scheduler (one cycler scheduler example)

B. Use custom dropout (MCAlphaDropout section)

C. Use custom normalization (MaxNormDense section)

D. Use tensorboard (see links)

E. Use custom loss function (HuberLoss section)

F. Use custom activation function, initializer regularizer and kernel weight constraint (sections leaky_relu, my_glorot_initializer, MyL1Regularizer, my_positive_weights)

G. Use custom metric (HuberMetric section)

H. Use custom layers (Sections: exponential_layer, MyDense, AddGaussianNoise, LayerNormalization)

I. Use custom model (ResidualRegressor and ResidualBlock sections)

J. Custom optimizer (MyMomentumOptimizer sections)

K. Custom Training Loop
