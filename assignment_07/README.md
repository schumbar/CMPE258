# Assignment 07 - Computer Vision

## Assignment Description

### Part 01 Description - Supervised Contrastive Learning

Write a colab to demonstrate supervised contrastive learning loss based supervised classification versus regular softmax based one. Please provide necessary visualizations.

Hint: See section labeled `Part 1 References`.

### Part 02 Description - Transfer Learning on Various Modalities

Write simple colabs to transfer learn on images, videos, audios - with both as a feature extractor as well as a fine tuning usecases.
Image: Showcase basic transfer learning for a classification task (either cats/dogs or breeds of dogs) in a colab - with both as a feature extractor as well as a fine tuning usecase
Hint: See section labeled `Part 2 References`.

### Part 03 Description - Zero-Shot Transfer Learning

Write a colab showcasing the following:

- zero-shot transfer learning using the CLIP model
- transfer learning using state of art models from tfhub (Eg: use bigtransfer for example)
